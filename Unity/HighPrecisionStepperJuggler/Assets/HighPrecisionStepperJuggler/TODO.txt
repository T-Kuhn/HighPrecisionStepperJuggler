// time intensive:
[ ] animate camera
    [ ] implement smooth camera moves with set positions
    [ ] make camera position switch programmable via TimeLineAnimator
    
// easy:
[ ] fix lighting (it should have the same direction as real lights)!
[ ] try to rebuild 5 time bouncing into strong bounce into balancing with twoStep-bouncing
[ ] make different BallControlStrategyCollections (the main sequence, the top view sequence, the close up sequence)
[ ] add a slowed down data sequence to circleBouncing (after 2 full cycles)
[ ] TwostepBouncingLow needs improvement (it fails after a short time)
    [ ] try tuned down correctionTilt to fix
[ ] get a good routine going
    [ ] come up with new flex?
    [ ] tweak graph animations
[ ] bring ball to halt by catching it softly.   
    [ ] this might just work be switching the up-down positions of one of the current Bounce ControlStrategies
[ ] "every bounce will be a bit higher"-bouncing
[ ] zig-zag bouncing (maybe moving towards center)

// vid:
[ ] front view, change to unity graphics, look around, end up in top view, change to realtime video again (top view)
[ ] first half: bouncing patterns and data visualization
[ ] second half: bouncing patterns (again) with close up footage and in game camera changes (top view, motor close up view, + maybe one more view)
 
script:
        [ ] setup camera at front position
        [ ] find matching in-game camera position (pos1)
        0. all kind of crazy stuff for 1 min.
        1. fade out all graphs via video editing software
        2. real camera footage only of twoStepBouncing ball
         
        first routine ends here. 
         
        [ ] setup camera at close up position
        [ ] find matching in-game camera position (pos2)
        [ ] deactivate all graphs and texts for this build
        0. STOP the drawing of all graphs and video streams in Unity and rebuild
        1. routine starts with two-step bouncing and in-game camera at pos1
        2. fade over from real footage
        3. camera move from pos1 to pos2 after x bounces
        4. stop taking footage after another x bounces
         
        second routine ends here.
         
        [ ] setup camera at top view position
        [ ] find matching in-game camera position (pos3)
        [ ] deactivate all graphs and texts for this build
        0. STOP the drawing of all graphs and video streams in Unity and rebuild
        1. routine starts with twostep bouncing and in-game camera at pos2
        3. camera move from pos1 to pos2 and then to pos3 after x bounces
        4. activate text and graph drawing again
        5. all kind of stuff for about 1min
        6. end
         
         

// next iteration TODO:

[ ] add radar style turning radius with fade to ball position visualization

[ ] make it possible to show data of second ball

[ ] 2 ball bouncing
    [ ] implemented code needed for this
    [ ] might be possible with Continuous2StepBouncingLow
    [ ] add ball 2 ball data
    [ ] add ball 2 ball data visualization
    [ ] bounce A -> just correct B -> just correct A -> bounce B -> just correct A -> just correct B -> bounce A?
    
[ ] add hit position heatmap
[ ] freeze datapoint-stream on ball data used by PID?
[ ] maybe hit ball without upwards motion when the ball moves very fast to get it under control faster.

[ ] maybe add a circleness check and discard detected object with a low circleness 
    Not really needed since there's normally not much noise in the video stream. But it'd be a nice to have.
    Just in case. Or for demos where there's a hand showing.

[ ] make radius result of image processing more precise (results differ from center to edge)

[X] check whether or not the tilt is constant when moving up with tilted plate
    [ ] turns out we DO have a problem with the tilt shifting ever so slightly while moving upwards with a tilted plate

[ ] fix runtime error that occurs when no camera is connected.
[ ] Write latex math file

memo:

lower link length: 89
upper link length: 80
upper most link length: 35 + 6.5 + 8 = 49.5 (from plate edge to joint) 
upper most link from joint to motor axis center: 49.5 + 21.023 = 70.523
